# Phase 135 Summary

## Summary
- Registered all CLI commands in the command palette with categories and prompt patterns.
- Wired palette execution to either run commands immediately or prefill the command line for args.

## Rationale
- Improves discoverability and makes the palette a complete entry point for workspace, file, and system commands.

## Tests
- Not run (not requested).
