# Phase 146 Summary

## Summary
- reserved a dedicated footer status row above the prompt in the workspace view.
- rendered a concise, mode-sensitive help hint in both VGA and framebuffer paths.
- added a small unit test for the new status line hint.

## Rationale
A persistent, non-scrolling status hint reduces the learning curve for new users and keeps core actions discoverable without interrupting workflow. The footer placement preserves the main output area and maintains prompt clarity.

## Tests
- Not run (not requested).
